This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the data was retrived from http://www.tvmaze.com/api 

This app allows you to search TV shows by name and view their summary, seasons and episodes information.

## Tech stack
- React
- SASS(Used dependency "node-sass")

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Solutions provided
For this take home challenge, I was able to review React framework as well as learning SASS from scratch. For this project, I was able to finish features like:
- Search TV title from the API and fetch TV Show information that includes seasons and episodes. 
- Display information in different layout through dropdown, select, timeline and tooltip.
- Built clear button to reset the searching.
- Mostly matched provided file in terms of design elements(font and font size).
- Responsive design with desktop and mobile. 

### Solutions needed
- Need to figure out the layout for season dropdown select. It has default layout now. 
- Also figure out how select works with responsive design especially with small screen like mobile.
- Timeline and tooltip posistions need to be improved.

### Improvements needed
- Double check the piled paper effect. 
- Improve responsive design including tablet and large screen.
